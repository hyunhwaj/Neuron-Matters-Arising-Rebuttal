# The reanalysis of Readhead et al. (Neuron, 2018)'s data

All R scripts and some outputs were used for my latest letter (published in Neuron). 
In the letter, we concerned about the statistical analysis performed in Readhead et al.'s 2018 study. 
For the details about our analysis, please read the first reference which we listed in the references session.
